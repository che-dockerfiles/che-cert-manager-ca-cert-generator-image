# Che Cert Manager CA certificate generator image

In case of deployment of Eclipse Che with TLS support, it uses Cert Manager to manage TLS certificates.
When Eclipse Che should be deployed with autogenerated self-signed certificate (default case when a user just starts Che), then this image is used to generate CA self-signed certificate.
The certificate will be consumed by Cert Manager which uses it for signing traffic encryption certificates.
